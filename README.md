### In this video we are going to create a central state using redux store and consume it in our components without passing it as a prop(named Second.js and Third.js)


Here is a summary of what and how we are going to implement it

# Call the useSelector hook to read data in React components
Call the useDispatch hook to dispatch actions in React components
Put <Provider store={store}> around your entire <App> component so that other components can talk to the store
